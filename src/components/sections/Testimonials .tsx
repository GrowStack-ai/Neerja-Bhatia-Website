She has a sharp sense of discernment, empathy, combined with a sweet personality that brings people together wherever she goes. She helped put together a few customized leadership workshops for my team when I was working at Red Hat and every one of her workshop was excellent and well-received. She connects the dots very quickly to understand the dynamics of your team and recommends solutions that will meet the needs of your team. I highly recommend Neerja to anyone seeking her expertise, you won't be disappointed.",
